# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

- Add CloudFront in front of the load balancer and make a rule that any ssh to instances should be done through AWS Systems Manager, which removes all external access to the instances.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

- Using only VPC private endpoints will not prevent unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

- No, after you enable default encryption, the encryption that you set applies only to future uploads. 

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

- All the configurations we made directly through the AWS management console to the original Cloudformation configuration would be reset.
