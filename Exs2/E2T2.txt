Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

After review Security Hub Findings and Amazon Inspector - Findings I found some thing:
1. Security groups should not allow unrestricted access to ports with high risk [3389, 20, 23, 110, 143, 3306, 8080, 1433, 9200, 9300, 25, 445, 135, 21, 1434, 4333, 5432, 5500, 5601, 22, 3000, 5000, 8088, 8888] 
2. S3 Block Public Access setting should be enabled at the bucket-level
3. Ensure MFA is enabled for the root user
4. Instance is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. This increases the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack.
5. Process 'sshd' is listening on TCP port 22 which is associated with 'SSH' and is reachable from the internet
6. Process 'systemd-network' is listening on UDP port 68 which is associated with 'DHCP' and is reachable from the internet

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
After research recommendations from AWS document :
1. Delete rules from a security group
2. Enable S3 bucket access logging
3. Add a hardware MFA device for the root user
4. To reduce the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack, we recommend that you configure your EC2 instance to prevent root account logins over SSH. To disable SSH root account logins, set PermitRootLogin to 'no' in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and restart sshd. When logged in as a non-root user, you can use sudo to escalate privileges when necessary. If you want to allow public key authentication with a command associated with the key, you can set **PermitRootLogin** to 'forced-commands-only'.
5. You can edit the Security Group to remove access from the internet on port 22
6. You can edit the Security Group  to remove access from the internet on port 68
